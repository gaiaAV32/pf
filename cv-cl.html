I am a Digital Designer living in London.
I’m currently working as digital designer for Avenue32, a London based e-tailer of luxury clothing and accessories which Vogue UK readers voted as the 2nd best online fashion retailer.

As web designer, I deal with HTML and CSS on a daily basis, along with JQuery and JavaScript.
I take care of a design project from the concept up to the final result.
I have a strong graphic design background and I am a branding and typography devotee <!-- (not sure if professional enough).  -->
Is my objective to deliver a seamless responsive & accessible site experience throughout all devices and browsers.




 in an agency role or proactively working with a variety of web development projects

Born in Italy, I grew up professionally in London and Paris.




Started as a small company, being one of just two designer, I gained experience and accomplished the responsabilities to manage my new bigger team and coordinate meetings and projects. I’ve been facing both Clients directly together with the Sales and Commercial department, partecipating with the Marketing team to the development of the brand identity into a consolidated voice, and expecially i worked closely with the Tech team to provide assets and layout for the web and software development. I was given the responsibility to personally design for some of the largest brands in the world, among which O2, Disney, Mark & Spencer, Ermenegildo Zegna, French Connection, Monarch and Thomas Cook Airline. After graduating from Central Saint Martins, University of Art in London, I’ve been working in Paris as junior graphic designer for Publicis, Royalties, but I decided to move back to London as i see it as the place to be if you really want to make a career and the city can offer you the best professional opportunities. I am very aware of the multichannel user experience and understand the importance in working within its limitations for maximum success. I have an excellent profile for your opening, having direct B2B, media and communications experience in my daily work life which involves Photoshop, Indesign, Illustrator, After Effects and HTML/CSS everyday and often work alongside our project and account management teams to ensure the clients expectations are met efficiently. I’ve learned to organise and manage a team on the inside and to respond when working and collaborating with other teams. I am accustomed to working under strict and quick deadlines, understanding the needs and communicative process that is essential for correct delivery to clients which each have different necessities and portfolios. Furthermore, I have worked for a very extensive list of clients, that range in verticals from Finance to Luxury Retail, therefore making me adaptive and aware of the distinctions and different market strategies every client has. To move my career to the next level, I’m currently learning Front End Development, after attending an intense course at General Assembly: my pursuit is to merge my graphic design skills with the logical elements that make a project “alive”. An example of what I accomplished can be tested on airplanemode.eu, an app that provides a clean interface with flight details such as departures times, weather conditions, departure and arrival Gate, delays, aircraft and Airline information, to accomplish not only a smooth user interactive jorney but also an actual travel experience in ease. Due to my upbringing, I am a heavily ambitious and international person, having lived in three countries and love seeking new culture frontiers. I am very eager to start my next chapter in a city that can give me a prospect of internationality, openness
